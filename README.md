This model is designed to forecast website traffic using the website's previous traffic. We followed a series of steps, starting from data collection, analysis, and feature extraction, to traffic prediction.

We used the SARIMA model because we observed a seasonal pattern in website traffic. So,  we prepared the data so that it fit this model and after training the model we collected the prediction and compared it to the actual values, and the model performed very well with less than 9.9% error.
